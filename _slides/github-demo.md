### Abstract
#### Abstract

Have you ever used some software and wondered if you could 
look at the source code to see how it worked?  
Or have you ever read some documentation with some typos and
wanted to fix them, even if only for yourself?
Or have you ever discovered a bug, came up with a fix, and
wanted to share the fix with others?
Well, I have.  
The good news is that more often than not, I was using OpenSource software.
The even better news is that it was likely hosted on GitHub given
that over 20 millions public projects are hosted there.
This talk will be about GitHub.
Not all of GitHub, as that would take several days without rest or bathroom breaks.

## Vertical slides

Slides can be nested inside of each other.

Use the **Space** key to navigate through all slides.

<a href="#" class="navigate-down">
  <img width="178" height="238" data-src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hakim-static/reveal-js/arrow.png" alt="Down arrow">
</a>

~~

## Basement level 1

Nested slides are useful for adding additional detail underneath a high level horizontal slide.

~~

## Basement level 2

That's it, time to go back up.

<a href="#/2">
  <img width="178" height="238" data-src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hakim-static/reveal-js/arrow.png" alt="Up arrow" style="transform: rotate(180deg); -webkit-transform: rotate(180deg);">
</a>

----

## Slides

Not a coder? Not a problem. There's a fully-featured visual editor for authoring these, try it out at [slides.com](http://slides.com).

----

## Point of view

Hold down **alt** and click on any element to zoom in on it using [zoom.js](http://lab.hakim.se/zoom-js). **alt** + **click** anywhere to zoom back out.

----

## Touch optimized

Presentations look great on touch devices, like mobile phones and tablets. Simply swipe through your slides.

function linkify( selector ) {
  if( supports3DTransforms ) {

    var nodes = document.querySelectorAll( selector );

    for( var i = 0, len = nodes.length; i &lt; len; i++ ) {
      var node = nodes[i];

      if( !node.className ) {
        node.className += ' roll';
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Marvelous lists

-   No order here

## Fantastic ordered lists

2.  Two is smaller than...
3.  Three!

| Apples   |    $1 |        7 |

## Clever quotes

These guys come in two forms, inline: <q cite="http://searchservervirtualization.techtarget.com/definition/Our-Favorite-Technology-Quotations">&ldquo;The nice thing about standards is that there are so many to choose from&rdquo;</q> and block:

> &ldquo;For years there has been a theory that millions of monkeys typing at random on millions of typewriters would reproduce the entire works of Shakespeare. The Internet has proven this theory to be untrue.&rdquo;

----

## Intergalactic interconnections

You can link between slides internally, [like this](#/2/3).

----

## Speaker view

There's a [speaker view](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#speaker-notes). It includes a timer, preview of the upcoming slide as well as your speaker notes.

Press the **S** key to try it out.

Notes:

Oh hey, these are some notes. They'll be hidden in your presentation, but you can see them if you open the speaker notes window (hit S on your keyboard).

----

## Take a moment

Press **B** or **.** on your keyboard to pause the presentation. This is helpful when you're on stage and want to take distracting slides off the screen.
